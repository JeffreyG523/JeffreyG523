- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JeffreyG523 and I'm sharing details on a porject I worked on. 

â€¢	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
 For this project we were working for Airgead Banking. I was given instructions to develop a code that allows customers to see how their investments will grow over time.
 
â€¢	What did you do particularly well? 
I think I did a good job developing the code and including proper naming conventions and adding in-line comments. In addition, I met all specifications listed in the
Airgead Banking App Functional Requirements and followed best practices described in the Airgead Banking Standards document.

â€¢	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
I could have improved my code by designing the pseudocode/flowchart that clearly outlines my program logic step-by-step. By doing this I would have helped to 
determine if learners can follow the underlying algorithm or describe a system in terms of an algorithm.

â€¢	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
I found some of challenges around having the code that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. In the beginning of the code,
I couldnâ€™t get algorithm to continue the calculation over time. I could get the code to compute interest for year but not over time. 

â€¢	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
The skills that are transferable to other projects are listing all the steps in a code along with comments that explain it. I also think writing a code 
that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time is always transferable. You can take the code and show other solutions over time. 

â€¢	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
I think to make the code dependable over time you can take extra time to think up a name thatâ€™s clear and reveals what the function, class, or variable does.
You can also keep your function short makes it easier to digest when youâ€™re reading and helps reduce bugs because there are just fewer moving parts that could
go wrong inside the function.
